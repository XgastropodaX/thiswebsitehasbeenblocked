Are You a Goblin?
<span title="False/MIsLeAdiNg InfoRmaaaaTiO-error-">Absolutely not, I can’t believe you would come into my website and ask me such ludacris 
questions such as these. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin">I</a> am not a goblin</span>

I mean I’m not sure why you would be asking someone like me,

How do you feel about being investigated by the NSA?

Does this agent really think we can’t see him?


Apparently so..
