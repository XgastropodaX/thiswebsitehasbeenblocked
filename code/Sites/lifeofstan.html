	Some stuff about me!

I know all the words to popular music like the one about the human who is a sharp tool 
in a shed. I really like that one.

<span title="False/Misleading Information Detected">I am very tall and handsome and have very strong muscles. </span>

I live in The You-ess-ay. You know, the place with the red stripes and 
the blue square in the corner? That one.

<span title="False/Misleading Information Detected">I am a vegetarian. Meat is gross. I only eat salad and stuff that is green.</span>

I watch the news a lot. There’s been a lot of coverage about a guy named Joe lately, 
although I don’t know why they always say bye to a guy called Dan after they mention him? 
Also, who is Dan? Is he Joe’s friend? The mystery remains...

<span title="False/Misleading Information Detected">I have a big awesome car that I drive all the time. </span>

<span title="False/Misleading Information Detected">I have a lot of human friends that I drive with and go and eat salads with.</span>

<span title="False/Misleading Information Detected">I am not a goblin. I have never been a goblin. End of story.</span>
