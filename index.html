	<pre>Hello Agent. We have recently been made aware of an invading, hyper intelligent species that live among humans. Evidence of their presence can be found throughout historical records, and mythologies alike.

They are cunning, adaptable, secretive and masters of disguise.

But above all else they are very, very dangerous.




You may know them, 


as goblins.

And they eat people too..



While extremely dangerous, they can be isolated and contained. Thanks to your most recent promotion, you have been tasked with discovering, researching, and eliminating their presence from the internet.


We discovered their breach of the internet three weeks ago.

5.23 seconds ago a program was installed onto your hardrive that will automatically detect flaws of logic, attempts to mislead, or any sort of false information when hoevered over with he mouse.

Your mission is to find any traces of them, report, and if the chance comes, to delete any goblin presence from the internet.

<a style="color:black" href="govpage.html">this link</a> will send you to a suspected site that may or may not be run by a goblin.

I have faith in you agent


eliminate them
